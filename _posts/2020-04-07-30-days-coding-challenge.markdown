For the past few months I have been learning Deep learning and Artificial intelligence. Most of my work till now has been in Python. And as much as I like to stay focused on a few libraries related to AI and ML only, I found that not a sustainable way to go.

There are few key things like Data handling, Data cleaning , web apps to deploy the model;  that need to be mastered for a good overall impact.

So my **Aim** would be to have an overall holistic skill for getting things done in Python.

**Main idea** – Learning basic skills to supplement the AI/Ml skill, and at the same time, not making it boring.

The reason why I am sharing it with all is to keep track of my progress, and meanwhile it might motivate some of you to work on something similar.

Below is my list of 30 days projects, with defined goals to achieve. I have intentionally kept a break for 2 days, to cover up for any un-eventup delays.

**CODING 30 days challenge(Starts 7 june,2020)**

1.  1.  Live Stock monitoring Web app
        *   Goal – access to stock values of 10 desired companies in python and web app
    2.  Stock market prediction web app
        *   Goal – ML approach to predict rise or fall of prices- in next 1 day,1 hour?
    3.  Enhancing DICOM images

        *   Goal – understand Robotic arm environment, Agent that can pick up objects
    26.  Training Mujuco – walking man OpenAI
        *   Goal -understand Mujuco arm environment, Agent that can walk properly
    27.  Training GymGo – RL OpenAi
        *   Goal – rules of GO, select 3 most basic moves, train an agent that can do the most basic moves.
    28.  Virtual “Old-data based Stock make Data generator
        *   Goal – different ways to generate fake data that makes sense, generate data for a assumed xyz company
    29.  Virtual AI investor
        *   Goal -generating fake currency, make predictions, ask it to invest, test how it performs
    30.  Creating your own RL environment
        *   Goal – plan simple rules and rewards for the environment, Train a Agent that can do the thing

I have decided primary and secondary goals for all of them. Aiming to achieve as much as possible.

Finally, i love talking to smart and interesting people. So, if you wish to talk or collaborate, please feel free to ping me. Whatever way you prefer.
