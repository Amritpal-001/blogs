MEDICAL IMAGENET
================

##### **Helping machines generalize medical imaging**

###### **Inspiration –**

Theoretically speaking, ImageNet consists of Natural images, hence using Pre-trained models on ImageNet are generally helpful.There is a huge difference in natural images and medical images, And fine-tune of model is generally required, which is known as transfer learning. Occasionally, transfer learning may be no better than training from scratch, as the networks learn very different high-level features in the two tasks.

But what if we had pre-trained model on medical images, where model understands a bit of all types of images – maybe that could be a better Pre-trained model to use for this specific task.

###### **Questions of interest –**

*   Explore the idea of generalized database like ImageNet in medical imaging. Is this a feasible thing to do?
*   Is Fine-tuning from ImageNet to a specific tasks as and when required a better approach ?
*   Is this even a solution we need? How good is transfer learning ?
*   Does Transfer learning has any limitations, on types of data it can switch to?

###### First layout of idea-

Here is the initial idea i thought about –

“Medical IMAGENET”

###### **Next Few Steps**

*   Has someone already done it before?
*   If not, why? What are the inherent problems in this task?
*   Is such a Dataset possible for medical imaging or is it too complex?

###### **Articles to get you started –**

*   [Understanding Transfer Learning for Medical Imaging](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/12/understanding-transfer-learning-for.html)
*   A scoping review of transfer learning research on medical image analysis using ImageNet – Mohammad Amin Morid, PhD , Alireza Borjali, PhD, Guilherme Del Fiol, MD, PhD [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13175](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13175)
*   [https://www.researchgate.net/post/Possible\_How\_Transfer\_learning\_for\_medical\_images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13175)

###### **How can you help?**

*   Literature review
*   Talking to expertise and expanding this idea.
*   Collect a list of potential Medical databases that can be used.
